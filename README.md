##  Pathology Classification

### Problem Statement
- To detect retinal diseases from given OCT image. - choroidal neovascularization (CNV), drusen, and diabetic macular edema (DME). 

### Abstract
- Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging medical technology for performing high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. Optical coherence tomography uses light waves to look inside a living human body. It can be used to evaluate thinning skin, broken blood vessels, heart diseases, and many other medical problems.Retinal optical coherence tomography is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time. Computer vision is emerging in healthcare. The amount of data that pathologists analyze in a day can be too much to handle. Luckily, deep learning algorithms can identify patterns in large amounts of data that humans wouldnâ€™t notice otherwise. It can detect various diseases in plants, animals, and humans. For this application, the goal is to get datasets from Kaggle OCT and classify data into different sections. 

### Approach
- From an OCT dataset, we produced a training dataset of 83,484 images and a test dataset of 1000 images. For training, the dataset comprises 37,205 images with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), 11,348 with diabetic macular edema (DME), 8616 with drusen, and 26,315 normal images. The test dataset has 250 images from each category. For classfication we will experiment starting from algorithm like mobilenet, resnet to state of the art algorithm to get the best possible outcome from the available research.

### Persona
- This can be used for medical analysis purpose.
